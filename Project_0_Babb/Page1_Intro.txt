But before that begins, it must be asked, what sort of man are you? Can you survive the trial by combat against your fellow champion, and truly ascend to the rank of Legend? Let battle be joined, let the fight commence!</div></p>

<p class="intro">Though many heroes walk through the Artherian fields, there are three guilds that have been chosen today. The noble Paladins of the Radiant order - defended by powerful shields and protected by the gods with powerful healing magics. The Society of Fighter, those who have trained with the sword since birth, using both their hands for a weapon to bring mightily upon their enemies. Last but not least, the Rangers of the Wood, moving swiftly through the battlefield with two swords, cutting through their enemies in a whirlwind of steel!
